Neutrophils help to fight infections. If you have high Neutrophil levels, it tells your doctor you have inflammation or infection somewhere in your body. If itâ€™s low, you could be at risk for infection. The normal range is 1.6 to 7.0 cells per 1000 mm^3 of blood.

### Single and multiple regressions, and scatterplots for clinical bloodwork 
([AnalyzeNeutrophils.R](../master/AnalyzeNeutrophils.R)) will allow you to load a comma-delimited .csv with various datapoints, perform single and multiple regressions of Body Mass Index (BMI) vs. Neutrophils and Neutropils_PCT from the Complete Blood Count with Differential (CBC-D) results, and produce 2-D scatterplots, one-way ANOVA with IBS-subtype as Independent Variable (X), and Neutrophils as Dependent Variable (Y). The output includes results of ANOVA test, a formatted box-and-whiskers plot and  and a formatted scattered plot.
 
Data (RobinsonEtAl_Sup1.csv) was downloaded from: 

Robinson, JM. et al. 2019. Complete blood count with differential: An effective diagnostic for IBS subtype in the context of BMI? BioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/608208.
